# Semester-2-Project

This folder contains Java-based projects developed during my second semester, showcasing more advanced concepts such as file handling, string manipulation, and basic database operations.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. **Address Book**
- **File**: `AddressBook.java`
- **Description**: A Java program to manage contacts using arrays. Features include:
  - Adding, editing, and deleting contact details.
  - Searching contacts by name or other attributes.

### 2. **Number Guessing Game**
- **File**: `NumberGuessGame.java`
- **Description**: A console-based game where the player guesses a randomly generated number, demonstrating loop structures and user interaction.

### 3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
- **File**: `Rock_paper_scissors.java`
- **Description**: A Java adaptation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with added complexity and a user-friendly interface.

### 4. **String Encrypter**
- **File**: `StringEncrypter.java`
- **Description**: A program to encrypt and decrypt strings using basic algorithms, emphasizing string manipulation techniques.

### 5. **Vigen√®re Cipher**
- **File**: `Vigenere.java`
- **Description**: Implements the Vigen√®re cipher for secure text encryption and decryption. This project highlights advanced string handling and algorithm implementation.

### 6. **Database Management System (DBMS)**
- **Folder**: `Database Management System/`
- **Details**:
  - **Main File**: `DatabaseManagementSystem.java`
  - **User Manual**: `User Manual.docx`
  - **Project Description Files**:
    - `CSC103 - PF Lab Project.pdf`: Detailed project requirements.
    - `PF Lab Project Groups.xlsx`: Group and syntax assignments.
  - **DBMS_TABLES**: Directory for storing generated database tables.

#### DBMS Features:
The DBMS allows users to perform the following operations using a case-insensitive query language:
- **CREATE**: Create a new table.
- **DROP**: Delete an existing table.
- **SHOW**: List all existing tables.
- **INSERT**: Add rows to a table.
- **SELECT**: Retrieve and optionally sort or filter data.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing rows based on conditions.
- **DELETE**: Remove rows from a table based on conditions.
- **HELP**: Display syntax for all commands.
- **EXIT**: Terminate the program.

#### Syntax Constraints:
- All operations must follow the syntax specified in the project description (refer to `CSC103 - PF Lab Project.pdf`).
- The system handles error checking for invalid commands or input.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **File Handling**: Text-based storage for database tables.

## üìå Key Learnings
- Practical implementation of file I/O and string manipulation.
- Designing and handling custom query languages.
- Working with modular and scalable Java programs.
