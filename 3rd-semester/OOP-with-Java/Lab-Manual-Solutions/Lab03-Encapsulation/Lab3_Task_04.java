/* Suppose you operate several hot dog stands distributed throughout town. Define an Encapsulated class named HotDogStand that has an instance variable for the hot dog standâ€™s ID number and an instance variable for how many hot dogs the stand has sold that day. Create a constructor that allows a user of the class to initialize both values. Also create a method named justSold that increments by one the number of hot dogs the stand has sold. The idea is that this method will be invoked each time the stand sells a hot dog so that you can track the total number of hot dogs sold by the stand.
Write a main method to test your class with at least three hot dog stands that each sell a variety of hot dogs. Use get function to display the hot dogs sold for each object. */
