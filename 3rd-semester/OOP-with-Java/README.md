# OOP-with-Java

## 📚 Repository Overview

Welcome to **OOP with Java**! This repository is a structured collection of my journey in learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java**. It builds upon my foundational Java knowledge from the previous semester and explores advanced OOP principles, design patterns, and real-world applications.

This repository contains **lecture notes, lab solutions, practice exercises, assignments, and a final semester project**, providing a comprehensive learning experience.

## 🔑 Key Topics Covered
- Understanding **Object-Oriented Paradigm** for problem-solving.
- Core OOP principles: **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**.
- Advanced concepts: **Abstract Classes, Interfaces, and Composition (Has-a relationship)**.
- **File Handling & Exception Management**.
- **GUI Programming**: Layout Managers and Event-Driven Programming.
- **Best Practices & Design Patterns** in Java.

This repository includes **solutions to lab exercises, assignments, and a final semester project**, ensuring hands-on learning.

## 📝 File Naming Conventions
To ensure clarity and consistency:

- **Notes**: Named descriptively (e.g., `OOP-Concepts.md`, `Java-GUI-Tips.md`).
- **Practice Exercises**: Organized by levels (`Basics-Practice`, `Advanced-Practice`).
- **Lab Solutions**: Files named based on activities (`Activity1.java`, `Task1.java`).
- **Assignments**: Problems named clearly (`Problem1.java`, `Problem2.java`).
- **Semester Project**: Structured in `Docs`, `Code`, and `Tests`.
