# Semester Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Semester Projects Repository**! This repository organizes all the programming projects I’ve worked on during my academic semesters. Each semester folder contains the projects I completed during that term, including descriptions, source code, and related documentation.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into semester-wise folders, with individual project files and directories. Here’s the updated folder structure:

```
