# CS Semester Projects
> A semester-wise journey through my CS projects — from fundamentals to full-featured apps.

Welcome to my **CS Semester Projects** repository! 🎓  
This repository serves as a structured portfolio of all the programming and software development projects I’ve completed throughout my academic journey as a Computer Science student.

Each semester is organized into its own folder, showcasing projects, assignments, lab tasks, and major semester projects across multiple domains — from basic Python games to advanced Java Swing GUIs and C++ data structure implementations.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into semester-wise folders, with individual project files and directories. Here’s the updated folder structure:

```

## 📚 Project Details

### **1st-Semester**:
Contains the projects completed during the first semester. These projects focus on basic programming concepts and problem-solving in Python.  
  - **tictactoe.py**: A Python-based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, demonstrating basic control structures and user interaction.  
  - **rock_paper_scissors.py**: A Python version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, showcasing loops and conditional statements.

### **2nd-Semester**:
Contains the projects completed during the second semester. These projects were developed using Java, focusing on basic programming techniques, file handling, and encryption concepts.  
  - **AddressBook.java**: A basic Java application that uses arrays to store and manage contact information.  
  - **NumberGuessGame.java**: A simple number guessing game written in Java, demonstrating loops and control structures.  
  - **Rock_paper_scissors.java**: A Java implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with straightforward logic.  
  - **StringEncrypter.java**: A program that encrypts and decrypts strings using basic algorithms.  
  - **Vigenere.java**: Implements the Vigenère cipher for encrypting and decrypting text, showcasing string manipulation techniques.  
  - **Database Management System**:
    - **DatabaseManagementSystem.java**: The main Java file for the DBMS project, implementing database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).  
    - **User Manual.docx**: A document explaining how to use the program, including setup and functionality.  
    - **Project Question Files**:  
      - **CSC103 - PF Lab Project.pdf**: The original project question provided by the instructor.  
      - **PF Lab Project Groups.xlsx**: Contains the assigned groups and method syntax for each group.  
    - **DBMS_TABLES**: A working directory created by the program to store the database tables.  

### **3rd-semester**:
Projects from the third semester focus on core programming disciplines including data structures, object-oriented design, and advanced Java concepts with GUI.  
- **DSA-with-Cpp**: A complete collection of lab tasks, assignments, and a comprehensive semester project based on real-world datasets. Implementations include:
  - Linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, AVL trees
  - Sorting/searching algorithms
  - Hashing, graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal)
- **OOP-with-Java**: Practice projects, assignments, and lab tasks that focus on object-oriented principles in Java:
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism
  - Interfaces, generics, file handling, exception handling
- **SmartCityProject-OOP-**: A full-featured Java Swing GUI project that integrates public transportation, energy grids, and emergency services. Designed using:
  - OOP concepts (abstract classes, interfaces, composition)
  - File handling using GSON
  - GUI design with Swing components
- **MongoDBProject**: A database-driven desktop application built using **JavaFX** and **Java Swing**, as part of the Database Systems course:
  - GUI-based CRUD operations interacting with a MongoDB backend
  - Combines form-based user input, dynamic data visualization, and responsive layout
  - Demonstrates integration of database functionality into Java desktop environments
